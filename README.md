## Built with NextJS

This project is set up as a monorepo for a NextJS web application and an Expo app for exporting to both iOS and Android mobile applications (work in progress).


### Entirely client side

So far there is no user management or API calls being made, so this web app runs entirely clientside using a mix of 
React context and local storage for managing user items.

### Future updates

I would like to add the mobile app version of this application when I get the time. The repo is currently set up for it, 
it will just be a matter of copying over the systems and adjusting things as needed to fit the native build process.
